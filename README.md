Here are some examples of how I have made my life in the BASH shell more comfortable.

"nodupes.sh" simply sorts a text file alphabetically and removes duplicated lines, which I find helpful after merging two datasets.

"update_installed_packages.sh," when ran from a root prompt, will update all installed software packages.

"unclefill.sh" will overwrite-fill a target file with a specified input pattern.

"cleaning_routine.admin.sh," when ran from a root prompt, will find all the schema files that are not used by any installed applications, remove the unused schema files, clean up bash history, and remove backup, DS_Store, Thumbs.db, and tmp files, clean up home directory, Java cache, SQLite3 history, system cache, rotated logs, thumbnail cache, X11 debug logs, clear the local package cache, remove packages that are no longer needed, and empty trashes.

"cleaning_routine.sh" will Rebuild Mozilla Firefox configuration from scratch, assuming there was a backup skeleton present, and then will clean up the home directory, Adobe Reader cache MRU and temp files, bash history, backup DS_Store Thumbs.db and tmp files, clean up gedit recent documents, Gnome run command and search history, clean up LibreOffice links2 SQLite3 histories, clean up system clipboard, desktop entry files and recent documents, and empty trashes.

As uploaded, the bashrcs follow a naming convention that should be easy to interpret.
